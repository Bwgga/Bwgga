Hi, I am Giovanna A. I am currently studying Computer Engineering at McGill University in Montreal. 
I'm looking to build up a portfolio of projects and learn as much about diverse topics in tech as I can.
I've known that I wanted to go into a computer related field for the absolute longest time (I think I was around
13 to 14 ish) because of how much I loved learning all sorts of science, maths (especially discrete maths, and more
theoretical topics like Ramsey theory), and electronics related things.

I am confident that I'll keep being curious about new technologies and programming techniques, and that I'll
keep strengthening my skills but challenging myself with weird projects.
